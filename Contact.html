                This was an assigment that I worked on for my design class. The purpose for the assignment to make a
            design that would influence the audience. For the project I choose to gamifly a fitness app. Like many people I am guilty of downloading an app
            on my phone and forgeting all about it, especially when it comes to fitness apps. So the goal is to encourage users to exercise by introducing competition through 
            gamiflying a fitness app.

                    <li>Researcher</li>
                    <li>Designer</li>
                    
                </ul>

            <p class="desptext">
                Reseach was collected by asking quesitons to participate 
                
                    What do you do on your phone?
                     How often do you play games?
                    What type of games do you play often?
                     Are you competitive?

            I used Figma to make my wireframe and finial prototype

            <h4 class="sub-title">Problem</h4>
            <p class="desptext">
                Like me many people I download a fitness app on my phone to excercise but after a while I forget about it and don't ever use it. Trying to find a way to encourage users to
                continuesly use the fitness app but introducing competition with their friends and family. 
            </p>
            <h4 class="sub-title">Goal</h4>
            <p class="desptext">
                The goal is to encourage users to exercise by introducing competition aganist their friends and family.
                
            </p>
            <h4 class="sub-title">Process</h4>
            <p class="desptext">
               The process was collecting data from users by interviewing the particpates, finding out the types of game they play. Creating a wireframe and  a prototype of the fitness app.
                Users are able to keep track of their fitness goals and are encouraged to exercise.
